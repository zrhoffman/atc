Building Traffic Control
************************
The build steps for Traffic Control components are all pretty much the same, despite that they are written in a variety of different languages and frameworks. This is accomplished by using Docker.

.. note:: Currently, both listed methods of building Traffic Control components will produce ``*.rpm`` files, meaning that the support of these components is limited to RedHat-based distributions - and none of them are currently tested (or guaranteed to work) outside of CentOS7, specifically.

Downloading Traffic Control
===========================
If any local work on Traffic Monitor, Traffic Router Golang, Grove or Traffic Ops is to be done, it is **highly** recommended that `the Traffic Control repository <https://github.com/apache/trafficcontrol>`_ be downloaded inside the ``$GOPATH`` directory. Specifically, the best location is ``$GOPATH/src/github.com/apache/trafficcontrol``. Cloning the repository outside of this location will require either linking the actual directory to that point, or moving/copying it there.

.. seealso:: The Golang project's ``GOPATH`` `wiki page <https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/GOPATH>`_

.. _pkg:

Build Using ``pkg``
===================
This is the easiest way to build all the components of Traffic Control; all requirements are automatically loaded into the image used to build each component.  The ``pkg`` command can be found at the root of the Traffic Control `repository <https://github.com/apache/trafficcontrol/blob/master/pkg>`_.

Requirements
------------
- `Docker <https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/>`_
- `Docker Compose <https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/>`_\ [1]_


Usage
-----
``./pkg [options] [projects]``

.. note:: The ``pkg`` script often needs to be run as ``sudo``, as certain privileges are required to run Docker containers

Options

-q      Quiet mode. Suppresses output.
-v      Verbose mode. Lists all build output.
-l      List available projects.

If present, ``projects`` should be one or more project names. When no specific project or project list is given the default projects will be built. Valid projects:

- docs
- grove_build\ [2]_
- grovetccfg_build
- source\ [2]_
- traffic_monitor_build\ [2]_
- traffic_ops_build\ [2]_
- traffic_ops_ort_build\ [2]_
- traffic_portal_build\ [2]_
- traffic_router_build\ [2]_
- traffic_stats_build\ [2]_
- weasel

Output :file:`{component}-{version}.rpm` files, build logs and source tarballs will be output to the ``dist/`` directory at the root of the Traffic Control repository directory.

.. [1] This is optional, but recommended. If a ``docker-compose`` executable is not available the ``pkg`` script will automatically download and run it using a container. This is noticeably slower than running it natively.
.. [2] This is a default project, which will be built if ``pkg`` is run with no ``projects`` argument

.. _build-with-dc:

Build Using ``docker-compose``
If the ``pkg`` script fails, ``docker-compose`` can still be used to build the projects directly. The compose file can be found at ``infrastructure/docker/build/docker-compose.yml`` under the repository's root directory. It can be passed directly to ``docker-compose``, either from the ``infrastructure/docker/build/`` directory or by explicitly passing a path to the ``infrastructure/docker/build/docker-compose.yml`` file via ``-f``. It is recommended that between builds ``docker-compose down -v`` is run to prevent caching of old build steps. The service names are the same as the project names described above in `Usage`_, and similar to the ``pkg`` script, the build results, logs and source tarballs may all be found in the ``dist`` directory after completion.

.. note:: Calling ``docker-compose`` in the way described above will build _all_ projects, not just the default projects.

.. seealso:: `The Docker Compose command line reference <https://docs.docker.com/compose/reference/overview/>`_

Building Individual Components
==============================
Each Traffic Control component can be individually built, and the instructions for doing so may be found in their respective component's development documentation.
